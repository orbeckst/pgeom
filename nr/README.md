Numerical Recipes code
======================

The code in the directory ``nr`` is from [Numerical Recipes in C, 2nd
edition][NR C] and is *not free* (with the exception of ``nrutil.c``
and ``nrutil.h``). You _should_ have a look at the online copy of the
book and then type the required code from the screen in your favourite
text editor. The files in the ``nr`` directory are only provided for
you to verify that your manual copy of the code is correct (e.g. by
using the UNIX ``diff`` utility).
